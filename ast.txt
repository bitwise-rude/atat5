How would the AST look like??

-- I don't know how actual AST parsing is done but
-- This is how mine works

---> AST = [[FX_1],[FX_2].....]
AST will be list of lists
each member list will be a function

[FX-1] ==> (fn_name, [expps])

expss = expression in side a function, they are gonna be another lists
exxps = NODES

blocks are also stored the same way with prefix BLOCK_1  and BLOCK_2 and so on
